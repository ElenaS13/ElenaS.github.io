# USC MS Computer Science - Graduate Coursework Projects

## Computer Science 572: Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines

### Project 1: Comparing search engines (Google vs. Bing)

The project compared the search results from Google and Bing for 100 pre-determined queries, determined the overlap with the search results, and calculated correlation using Spearman's rank coefficient (Spearman's rho).

#### Languages, Libraries, and Frameworks:

- Java
- Jsoup
- Gson
- Apache Commons CSV
- Apache Commons Math


### Project 2: Web Crawling 

The project leveraged crawler4j library to crawl a news site and gather/measure various aspects of the crawl, study crawl characteristics and gather webpage metadata. 

#### Languages, Libraries, and Frameworks:

- Java
- Crawl4j
- Jsoup
- Open CV
- Sleepycat Berkeley DB






## Computer Science 576: Multimedia Systems Design (Spring 2023 taught by Instructor Parag Havaldar)

### Final Project: Interactive Media Player  

The project's purpose is to provide an in-depth understanding of multimedia technology. The project involves extracting structure from media elements (video/audio) and building an interactive media player for exploring the media content. The project represents a solution that automatically creates a logical index or table of contents from a video with audio input.

## Extracting Indexes from Video:

- The project creates a solution that automatically builds a logical index or table of contents from a video with audio input.
- The index is hierarchical .
- The project relies on both visual and auditory information in the input video file.

## Interactive Media Player:

- Once the index is extracted, the project builds an interactive media player that allows users to explore the media content.
- The media player enables users to jump to any index and browse the video/audio interactively.
- The audio and video components are synchronized.
- Basic player controls (play, pause, stop) are provided.
  
## User Interface Design:

- The project includes a simple, functional interface that displays the extracted table of contents alongside the video.
- The table of contents is hierarchical and allows selection of different segments (scenes, shots).
- The interface supports play, pause, and stop buttons.
