# USC MS Computer Science - Graduate Coursework Projects

## Computer Science 572: Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines

### Project 1: Comparing search engines (Google vs. Bing)

The project compared the search results from Google and Bing for 100 pre-determined queries, determined the overlap with the search results, and calculated correlation using Spearman's rank coefficient (Spearman's rho).

#### Languages, Libraries, and Frameworks:

- Java
- Jsoup
- Gson
- Apache Commons CSV
- Apache Commons Math


### Project 2: Web Crawling 

The project leveraged crawler4j library to crawl a news site and gather/measure various aspects of the crawl, study crawl characteristics and gather webpage metadata. 

#### Languages, Libraries, and Frameworks:

- Java
- Crawl4j
- Jsoup
- Open CV
- Sleepycat Berkeley DB



## Computer Science 576: Multimedia Systems Design

### Final Project: Media Player

The projects calls for building out an audio and video player powered by Java Swing. The player also extracts structure from media elements like audio/video with indexes and enables interactive exploration. The interactive player should allow seamless exploration by selecting various segments (scenes, sequences, shots). The hierarchical table of contents should show breakdowns at different levels: sequence/scene, individual shot, and subshot (if applicable). Interactively selecting a segment should highlight it, and playing the video should start from the beginning of the selected segment.
